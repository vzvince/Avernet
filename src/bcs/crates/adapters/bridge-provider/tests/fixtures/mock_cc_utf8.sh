# Mock cfuse --cc engine for the UTF-8 regression (Task 16): read one stdin
# line (the user message), then emit 40 Chinese `text_delta` stream events
# followed by a terminal `result/success`. Each line is a complete JSON event
# the cc driver maps to a `chat_delta` SSE frame (spec §5/§6).
#
# `resp.text()` must observe valid UTF-8 throughout (no half-character byte
# slicing), and every `data:` line must parse as JSON. Uses /bin/echo
# (external, flushes its stdio buffer on exit) so the driver observes each
# delta line before the script exits — a bash `printf` builtin would
# block-buffer a non-tty stdout and deadlock the turn.
