# BCN API Contracts

## Public Event Contract

`events/v1/catalog.yaml` is the authoritative inventory for public BCS Event
types and registered family wildcards. `events/v1/event-envelope.schema.json`
defines the versioned envelope plus the discriminated data schema for every
catalog Event. `events/v1/content-projection.schema.json` is the single shared
shape for metadata-only and full projections of externally visible content.

The Rust runtime registry in `bcs-eventing` loads the checked-in Catalog at
compile time; it must not copy the Event list into Rust constants. Internal
Judge/runtime events are intentionally outside this public Contract.

Validate the Catalog, schemas, representative payload modes, and fixtures:

```bash
uv run --with pytest --with pyyaml --with jsonschema \
  pytest src/bcs/tests/event_contract -q
```

## Provider gRPC SDK Demo Contract

`provider-demo/v1/provider_demo.proto` is the canonical cross-language wire
contract for the Python SDK, Java SDK, and standalone Rust client demo. It
defines one unary `ProviderDemo.Invoke` operation solely to validate SDK
inheritance and gRPC interoperability.

Validate the checked-in contract shape without changing repository-wide
Python dependencies:

```bash
uv run --with pytest pytest src/bcs/tests/provider_grpc_sdk_demo -q
```

This demo contract is separate from, and does not modify, the current Provider
SSE protocol. It is not the final bidirectional Provider streaming contract.

## Collaboration HTTP APIs

`v1/openapi.yaml` is the source of truth for the versioned public BCN OpenAPI.
`v1/internal.yaml` is the source of truth for the versioned internal BCN
collaboration API. Domain models and resource path items live in separate YAML
fragments so a domain can evolve without creating one monolithic file.

The current public OpenAPI contract contains 44 approved operations across Bot,
Group, GroupParticipant, Session, SessionParticipant, Invitation, Friendship,
FriendRequest, Event Subscription, Event Delivery, and session-bound WebSocket
resources. Every public operation is published below the single BCN ownership
prefix `/openapi/v1/collaboration/**`. These are the exact endpoints served
externally by BCN.

The Human control-plane Bot batch contains exactly five public operations:

- `POST /openapi/v1/collaboration/bots/query`
- `GET /openapi/v1/collaboration/bots/{bot_id}`
- `PATCH /openapi/v1/collaboration/bots/{bot_id}`
- `GET /openapi/v1/collaboration/bots/mine`
- `GET /openapi/v1/collaboration/bots/{bot_id}/candidates`

Bot candidate search moved to the internal contract:

- `GET /api/v1/collaboration/bots/{bot_id}/candidates/search`

Gateway treats User, App, and Bot Principals as optional inputs for this
internal route. That metadata controls Gateway admission only: BCS still
requires a usable Human identity and verifies that the selected physical Bot
is managed by that Human, or that the Human Actor perspective represents the
same Human. App and Bot identities do not replace the Human requirement.

The candidates operation accepts either a physical Bot managed by the current
Human or that Human's own `human_{subject.id}` record (including Human Actor).
Both perspectives use the same discovery and collaboration filters, and the
response still contains physical Bot candidates only. The candidate-search
operation is the versioned projection of legacy `/actors/search`: it uses
semantic worker recommendation first, preserves its score/profile/tag
enrichment, then falls back to a Bot-name substring search when no usable
recommendation is available. An omitted `q`, `q=`, and a whitespace-only `q`
are equivalent: each returns `items: []` with `search_mode: empty_query` without
invoking downstream search. Semantic and fallback results use
`search_mode: semantic` and `search_mode: name_fallback`; fallback items omit
`score`. Raw BCSFuse recommendation context is never part of the V1 response.
The path `bot_id` replaces legacy `current_bot_uuid`; `purpose` replaces
`cooperatable_only`; Gateway `ctoken` is not part of the BCN contract.

These public bot operations deliberately do not add generic `GET /bots`,
legacy `/actors/**` aliases, runtime discovery, or a separate descriptor patch
route. All public bot operations require a Human Principal. The Bot domain
object is discriminated by `kind=bot|human`; omission of a `kind` query filter
means both kinds rather than a synthetic `all` enum value.

Global collaboration Session resources remain public at
`/openapi/v1/collaboration/sessions/{session_id}/**`. Creating and listing a
Group's Sessions remains nested at
`/openapi/v1/collaboration/groups/{group_id}/sessions`. The shared ownership
prefix separates both resources from Backend and BaaS paths while preserving
their natural names.

Session collection adds two idempotent Human control-plane operations at
`/openapi/v1/collaboration/sessions/{session_id}/collect`. `POST` collects and
`DELETE` uncollects on behalf of the required `participant` Bot. BCN verifies
that the authenticated Human owns that Bot and that the Bot participates in
the Session; collection state remains attributed to the Bot rather than the
Human caller.

Session-bound WebSocket access adds two operations to that HTTP surface:

- `POST /openapi/v1/collaboration/sessions/{session_id}/token` issues the
  short-lived connection credential after normal user authentication and
  session authorization.
- `GET /openapi/v1/collaboration/messages/ws?token=...` describes the WebSocket
  HTTP Upgrade handshake. The OpenAPI contract intentionally covers only the
  connection credential, authentication failures, and `101` upgrade response;
  WebSocket message envelopes remain governed by the existing protocol tests.

The WebSocket operation uses `x-avernet-protocol: websocket` so publication
and Gateway integration can distinguish an Upgrade endpoint from an ordinary
HTTP GET without inventing a JSON response body for status `101`.

Session files moved to the internal contract as nine operations under
`/api/v1/collaboration/sessions/{session_id}/**`: list, prepare, metadata,
delete, proxy upload, complete, protected download, share, and public shared
download. Protected operations declare User, App, and Bot as optional Gateway
identities and use `x-bcn-identity-policy: human_or_owned_bot`; BCN still
requires a valid Human or Bot actor and checks a co-present Bot's signed owner
claim against the User. Shared download declares an empty Gateway requirement
because its share token is the credential. The two download operations use
`x-avernet-raw-response: true` to document `200` byte streams and `302`
redirects instead of JSON success envelopes.

Collaboration templates moved to the internal contract as two read-only
operations under `/api/v1/collaboration/templates` and
`/api/v1/collaboration/templates/{template_id}`. They are the versioned
projection of legacy `GET /collaboration/templates` and
`GET /collaboration/templates/{template_id}`: the list returns the registry
catalog with localized text, the single-template read returns the raw
collaboration-definition YAML as `text/yaml` by default (`format=yaml`) or the
detail wrapped in the standard envelope (`format=json`). Catalog reads are not
scoped to a Bot or Session and declare optional User, App, and Bot Gateway
identities; the `text/yaml` success uses `x-avernet-raw-response: true`.

Validate the contract:

```bash
uv run --with pyyaml python src/bcs/scripts/validate_openapi_contract.py \
  --root src/bcs/api-contracts/v1
```

Build a deterministic, self-contained OpenAPI document for Swagger UI, Redoc,
Gateway aggregation, or client generation:

```bash
uv run --with pyyaml python src/bcs/scripts/bundle_openapi_contract.py \
  --root src/bcs/api-contracts/v1 \
  --output-dir /tmp/bcn-openapi
```

Export the same validated public contract as deterministic JSON for Gateway
`/docs` consumption:

```bash
uv run --with pyyaml python src/bcs/scripts/dump_openapi.py \
  /tmp/bcn.openapi.json
```

Export the internal contract for Gateway `/internal-docs` consumption:

```bash
uv run --with pyyaml python src/bcs/scripts/dump_openapi.py \
  /tmp/bcn.internal.openapi.json \
  --entrypoint internal.yaml \
  --path-prefix /api/v1/collaboration/
```

Pass `--root src/bcs/api-contracts/v1` to export a different checked-out
contract root. The generated JSON is self-contained: source-fragment `$ref`
entries are resolved and discriminator mappings point inside the JSON document.

Run the contract tests without changing the repository-wide Python
dependencies:

```bash
uv run --with pytest --with pyyaml \
  pytest src/bcs/tests/openapi -q
```

Generated bundle outputs are build artifacts and are not committed from BCS.
The Gateway-owned schema snapshots `src/gateway/configs/schemas/bcn.openapi.json`
and `src/gateway/configs/schemas/bcn.internal.openapi.json` must be regenerated
from these contracts when Gateway consumers need updated BCN API JSON. The
candidate YAML is reviewed before implementation;
compatibility checks compare later revisions against an approved baseline.
